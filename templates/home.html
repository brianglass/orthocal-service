		<h1>Orthodox Calendar Service</h1>
		<p>Orthocal-service is an Eastern Orthodox calendar service providing a
		RESTful api describing commemorations, fasting, scripture readings and
		other information for each day of the liturgical year. This service is
		meant to be a tool for mobile developers and parish webmasters to use to
		provide this information to parishioners and other guests. My primary
		purpose for building it was to build a service to support a daily
		scripture reading skill for the Amazon Alexa.
		</p>

		<p>Presently the service is Beta-quality. Use at your own risk. With
		assistance, I may eventually provide support for other US jurisdictions, but
		presently only the OCA is supported.  
		<a href="https://github.com/brianglass/orthocal-service">Source code</a>
		and a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/brianglass/orthocal-service/">docker
		image</a> for self-hosting are freely available.</p>

		<h2>Algorithm</h2>
		<p>The algorithm and data used in this service are based on the
		algoritm and data developed by Paul Kachur's 
		<a href="https://github.com/paulkachur/orthodox_calendar">orthodox_calendar</a> project. 
		As such, the commemoration data is incomplete.  The primary
		purpose of this service is to provide daily scripture readings for lay
		persons and not to be an authoritative guide to the feasts and fasts of the Church.</p>

		<h2>Scriptures</h2>
		<p>Because this is open-source and free, the service must use a
		translation of the Bible that is either public domain or has agreeable
		license terms. At this point I have chosen to stick with the King James
		Version. While not ideal, many clergy consider this to be one of the
		best options for Orthodox. Because the rubrics refer to Septuagint
		versification, a few of the Old Testament readings may be incorrect.
		These are known bugs.</p>

		<h2>RESTful API</h2>
		<p>The api supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).  Information
		for a day of the year can be fetched by including the jurisdiction and
		date in the url as follows:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			/api/&lt;jurisdiction&gt;/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt;/<br/>
			/api/&lt;jurisdiction&gt;/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/
		</blockquote>

		<p>For example:</p>

		<blockquote><a href="/api/oca/2018/2/20/">/api/oca/2018/2/20/</a></blockquote>

		<p>Though the month view excludes the text of scriptures due to size
		and performance, you can fetch information for all of February using
		the following:</p>

		<blockquote><a href="/api/oca/2018/2/">/api/oca/2018/2/</a></blockquote>

		<p>To get information for today, simply leave off the date as follows:</p>

		<blockquote><a href="/api/oca/">/api/oca/</a></blockquote>

		<h2>Calendar</h2>

		<p>An ical feed is also available at:</p>

		<blockquote><a href="/api/oca/ical/">/api/oca/ical/</a></blockquote>
