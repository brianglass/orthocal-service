		<h1>Orthodox Calendar Service</h1>
		<p>Orthocal-service is an Eastern Orthodox calendar service providing a
		RESTful api describing commemorations, fasting, scripture readings and
		other information for each day of the liturgical year. This service is
		meant to be a tool for parish webmasters to use to provide this
		information to parishioners and other guests.
		</p>
		<p>Presently the service is Alpha-quality. Use at your own risk. The
		plan is to eventually provide support for major US jurisdictions, but
		presently only the OCA is supported. 
		<a href="https://github.com/brianglass/orthocal-service">Source code</a> and a 
		<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/brianglass/orthocal-service/">docker
		image</a> for self-hosting are freely available.  </p>
		<p>Information for a day of the year can be fetched by including the
		jurisdiction and date in the url as follows:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			/api/&lt;jurisdiction&gt;/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt;/<br/>
			/api/&lt;jurisdiction&gt;/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/
		</blockquote>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<blockquote><a href="/api/oca/2018/2/20/">/api/oca/2018/2/20/</a></blockquote>
		<p>Though the month view excludes the text of scriptures due to size
		and performance, you can fetch information for all of February using
		the following:</p>
		<blockquote><a href="/api/oca/2018/2/">/api/oca/2018/2/</a></blockquote>
		<p>To get information for today, simply leave off the date as follows:</p>
		<blockquote><a href="/api/oca/">/api/oca/</a></blockquote>
